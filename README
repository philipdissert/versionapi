This project is the Backend of "Version API".

The "Version API" is a small API where developers can find out the newest versions of commonly used tools and software packages centralized at one point.

Use `yarn start` to start the backend server. It will then get hosted on `localhost:3300`

Multiple API Endpoints will then get hosted on:
```
/api/user
/api/posts
/api/keys
/api/emailverify

```

The backend provides user login, user registration and an authenticated API requests.
